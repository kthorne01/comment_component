 <!-- my comment.js is a custom tag that displays a single comment 

 When I see this in the DOM ....

 Custom HTML Element 
 this is what it looks like in the HTML

 <custom-comment
    name="Julius"
    email="????"
    comment="text text text"
    ></custom-comment>

I replace it with this (tags the browser actually understands)

<section class="comment">
    <div class="user-info">
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/100?num=${rn}"
    alt="Your Avatar!" class="avatar" />
    <div>
        <p>${this.getAttribute("name")}</p>
        <p>${this.getAttribute("email")}</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p class="comment-text">
        ${this.getAttribute("comment")}</p>
    <p> ${this.getAttribute("timestamp"")}</p>
    </section>


*****************************************************
The job of the comment-list.js is to:
1. At the very beginning, draw all the comments.
2. If it gets notified that a new comment has been created, it should insert a new 
<custom-comment> tag to the top of the container in the DOM. 

    In order to get notified, the comment list needs to tell the state manager that it's interested
    in being notified. It needs to subscribe to the notification it wants to receive.

******************************************************************
The job of the form-component.js is to:
1. Create a form template (inputs, buttons, labels, elements) and inserts that form into the DOM.
2. It also notifies the state manager when a user clicks the submit button with the required fields entered.
3. Builds a comment object.

database-tests.js

The goal of this file is to:

1. Create a brand new database
2. Create a new data store called "comments", which is a container to put all of our comments in.
